                A bowl is a place for delicious complementary ingredients. These ingredients are my favorite together!!

                    Inspired by Sweet Green's harvest bowl,
                    which has kale & wild rice as a base, chicken breast, goat cheese, apples, sliced almonds, any dressings, and of course roasted sweet potato. 
                    <br><br>
                    I LOVE THIS SO MUCH especially mixing it and getting a bit of everything in a bite, somehow it tastes better together!! 
                    There must be a science behind why it tastes so good when normally I wouldn't choose to eat kale, except in smoothies. I think that 
                    the ingredients complement and balance each other. It is also pretty versatile you can choose your own base and experiment. This is the version
                    I like because I think goat cheese is a strong flavor and salmon and quinoa are so good together. Also my bowl is warm cause the salmon and quinoa are hot 
                    and when it mixes with the dijon mustard seed that gives a bit of acidity!! The texture of the quinoa is integral to the dish. Every component is important
                    except for the cheese IMO but salmon, kale, quinoa, and some dressing are the essentials. Apples, cheese, nuts etc. are toppings!!
                    <br><br>
                    I crave this and it is a bit more affordable than $16 bowls. Trader Joe's sells Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon for $14/lb which is a bit pricy but salmon
                    is more expensive than chicken breasts. Also a pound of Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon is 2 servings for me. And it is worth the price because Wild Salmon
                    is a treat and nutritious. I always leave the skin on except some scales remain, and in the future I hope I can get my fish from a market or something like that
                    so I don't have to scale the fish myself. The skin is crispyyyy. I eat this for my long runs. Recently, I have ran 8 miles to the West Meadow Beach 4 miles away and then back
                    on Saturday and it is good to fuel myself. I cook the entire 1lb of sockeye salmon at once and then have leftovers tomorrow as a bowl again ðŸ˜ƒ
                    <br><br>
                    I like bowls for meals because they feel complete and also the name Harvest Bowl from SG is a great name. I like that it makes it sound like it is using vegetables
                    from the season. Apples and Sweet Potatoes are my favorite Fall foods and do go very well as toppings in a bowl.

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <p>Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon, Avocado Oil (other high temp), Salt, Quinoa, Kale, Apple, any Cheese, Dijon Mustard or other dressing</p>
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <p> Cook quinoa. Scale the salmon if necessary. Salt liberally on both sides because we're not salting the kale or quinoa. Wait 15 minutes 
                for moisture and the salmon temp to come down. Prep the apple cutting to cube and cut cheese to cubes. Pat down salmon and heat generous oil to medium.
                Wait till the pan is hot and then put the salmon skin side down. Be sure to press the salmon down with some weight because in the heat it curls and we
                want the entire skin to be crispy. Cooking time depends on the thickness but around 6 minutes or color up 2/3's of the way. We want to cook the salmon skin
                side down for most of the process to get crispyness. Only flip once and cook for 2 mins or so more till fully cooked. Place kale on the bottom a lot. And quinoa
                and the salmon, apple, cheese and dijon mustard.
