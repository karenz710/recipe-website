                    Inspired by Sweet Green's harvest bowl,
                     which I first had Junior year of high school (3 years ago), 
                    I kept thinking of them until I decided to try to make them and I am glad I did. 
                    <br><br>
                    They are my favorite food as a post-run snack that fuels me, tastes super good, and are convenient. 
                    Just preheat the oven to 425, cut, oil, salt and leave them in the oven for 50 minutes to an hour. Roasting them is my favorite form. 
                    I’ve tried mashed sweet potatoes too which are delicious in their own rights but they are slightly more labor intensive. 
                    <br><br>
                    I like having them also as a side whether that is to a tomato veggie soup or a copycat SG harvest bowl.
                    <br><br>
                    I went through 5 pounds of sweet potatoes last week from Trader Joe’s, and this week probably as well. 
                    It is definitely a staple of mine.

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <p>Sweet potato, Avocado Oil (other high temp), Salt</p>
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <p> Wash the sweet potato. Cut sweet potato length wise. Cut into pretty thick slices. It does not need a lot of oil, add salt. The thinner they are the more crispy. 425 in the oven for an hour. 
                I like when it caramelizes a bit on the flat side touching the pan!! I don't flip the pan or do anything and it comes out delicious. Do check on them because if they are thin
                they can burn. And also avoid overlapping.
