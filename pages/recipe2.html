                I have this most days for breakfast. 
                <span id="dots">...</span>
                <span id="more"> I mean practically everyday 
                    since high school because it is convenient, affordable, and makes me feel satiated.
                    I have always been a fan of Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Oats but I like rolled oats as well.
                    <br><br>Currently I like my oatmeal with frozen wild blueberries from Trader Joeâ€™s for breakfast. I add about 1/4 cup wild blueberries. 
                    Other frozen berries are good as well but the small blueberries defrost thoroughly in the hot oatmeal.
                    <br><br>Other ideas include banana and cocoa powder.
                    <br><br>I reheat oatmeal adding a bit of water and microwaving, it stores in the fridge for 3-5 days.
                    <br><br>My breakfast everyday is oatmeal and an omelet! Omelet for the protein, although the oatmeal itself has about 6 grams of protein.

            <p>I make 1 dry cup at once and eat 1/3 cup per serving ~ 230 cals for Bob's Red Mill. Add 3 water to 1 oats, so 3 cups of water for 1 cup dry oats.
                Boil and turn to low medium heat uncovered for 15-25 minutes. </p>
